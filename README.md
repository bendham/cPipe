# What Is This?

Due to the repetitive nature of reducing data for the Chandra X-ray Telescope, many things can be automated. As such, I tasked myself with creating a multitude of scripts to provide quick and easy data set-up, reduction, and analysis for the downloaded data sets. These scripts are not finalized, and may lack many wanted features, but these can be added in due time. For now only fundamental things can be done, which is fine for the nature of a quick and easy data reduction.

# How Do I Use It?

I will write these instructions in due time.
